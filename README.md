# Business Intelligence Dashboard for Workspace Occupancy & Revenue Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world Business Intelligence (BI) use case focused on analyzing workspace occupancy and revenue data to support data-driven decision-making. The goal is to demonstrate how BI teams clean, validate, explore, and visualize data to generate actionable insights for business leaders.

The project aligns closely with responsibilities of a BI/Data Analytics Intern, including data exploration, report QA, dashboard development, and business-focused storytelling.
